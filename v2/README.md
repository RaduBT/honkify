# Detrumpify2

## Very simple Chrome Extension to replace instances of the words "Donald Trump" with more apt descriptors

Ths initial batch (and still most of the replacement text) comes from here:

http://theslot.jezebel.com/in-honor-of-donald-trumps-70th-birthday-here-are-70-wa-1781899319

However, I will continue to add new insults as I come by them throughout the
2016 presidential election cycle.

## Installation

You can clone the folder and just load the extension by going to chrome://extensions.  You'll also have to enable developer mode.

Or you can just get the published version here: <TBD>
