# Detrumpify

## Very simple Chrome Extensions to replace instances of the words "Donald Trump" with more apt descriptors

There are two version here that will be maintained independently, 
at least until I'm satisfied that v2 is better.

v1 -- very simple, everything is hard-coded
v2 -- configuration is loaded from external json. User has small amount of configurability by being able to change the json source url

See the respective READMEs in v1 and v2 for more info.
