# Detrumpify

## Very simple Chrome Extension to replace instances of the words "Donald Trump" with more apt descriptors

This extension is based on minor modification of the code here:

And the replacement text comes from here:

http://theslot.jezebel.com/in-honor-of-donald-trumps-70th-birthday-here-are-70-wa-1781899319

## Installation

You can clone the folder and just load the extension by going to chrome://extensions.
You'll also have to enable developer mode.

Or you can just get the published version here:
