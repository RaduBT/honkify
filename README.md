# Detrumpify

## Very simple Chrome Extensions to replace instances of the words "Donald Trump" with more apt descriptors

There are two version here that will be maintained independently, 
at least until I'm satisfied that v2 is better.

### v1

- very simple, everything is hard-coded
- this is the version live on the Chrome web store and on Mozilla FF add-on site

### v2

- configuration is loaded from external json, so the user can provide their own to mock whoever they want however they want.
- User has small amount of configurability by being able to choose among some pre-canned configurations.

See the respective READMEs in v1 and v2 for more info.
