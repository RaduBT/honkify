# Detrumpify

## Very simple Chrome Extensions to replace instances of the words "Donald Trump" with more apt descriptors

There are two version here that will be maintained independently,
at least until I'm satisfied that v2 is always better.

### v1

- very simple, everything is hard-coded
- On the Chrome Web Store this is called "Detrumpify Classic"
- This version is the only version on the Mozilla FF add-on site

### v2

- This is the recommended version for use going forward. This is called
"Detrumpify" on the Chrome Web Store
- User has small amount of easy configurability by being able to choose
among some pre-canned configurations.
- configuration is loaded from external json or the user can edit the json
directly, making arbitrary changes.

See the respective READMEs in v1 and v2 for more info.
