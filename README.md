# Detrumpify

## Very simple Chrome Extensions to replace instances of the words "Donald Trump" with more apt descriptors

There are two version here that will be maintained independently,
at least until I'm satisfied that v2 is always better.

### v1

- original version, very simple, everything hard-coded
- deprecated
- On the Chrome Web Store this is called "Detrumpify Classic"

### v2

- This is the current version. It is called "Detrumpify" on the Chrome 
Web Store and in the Firefox Add-On page.
- User has small amount of _easy_ configurability by being able to choose
among some pre-canned configurations.
- configuration is loaded from external json or the user can edit the json
- User get a large amount of more difficult configurability by means of 
editing config files.
directly, making arbitrary changes.

See the respective READMEs in v1 and v2 for more info.
