# Detrumpify Historical Original

## Very simple Chrome Extension to replace instances of the words "Donald Trump" with more apt descriptors

This folder is kept just to show what the original V1 Detrumpify looked
like. All the insults were hard-coded and there were no user options.

The extension is based on minor modification of the code here:

And most of the replacement text comes from here:

http://theslot.jezebel.com/in-honor-of-donald-trumps-70th-birthday-here-are-70-wa-1781899319

## Installation

You can clone the folder and just load the extension by going to chrome://extensions.
You'll also have to enable developer mode.

The published version here:

Does not reflect this code anymore.
